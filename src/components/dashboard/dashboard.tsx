Use the `rateLimited` and `retryAfter` values returned by `callAiWithRetry`. Display an `Alert` component when an operation is rate-limited, showing a countdown timer until the next attempt is possible. Disable the relevant buttons (Generate, Tune, Analyze) while the rate limit is active for that specific operation, adding a tooltip to indicate the wait time.
